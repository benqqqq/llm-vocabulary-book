# Progress

## What Works

1. Simplified the application to focus only on the vocabulary feature
2. Updated the database schema to include only necessary tables
3. Modified the App.tsx to only include vocabulary routes
4. Updated the README and documentation
5. Replaced the Markdown component with a simpler HTML-based approach
6. Created memory bank documentation
7. Removed all GPT playground code references and renamed the database
8. Completely removed all GPT playground components and pages
9. Made the vocabulary component the homepage without redirect
10. Removed unused common components (Markdown, CopyToClipboard, TextareaAutosize, TextInputModal, DiffLine, Head, useSnackbar)
11. Removed additional unrelated files:
    - services/getFruits.ts
    - types.ts with IFruit interface
    - utils.ts with unused helpers
    - mocks directory with fruit API mocks
    - Empty UI components directory
    - Simplified test files and removed mock server references

## What Needs Attention

1. There are still dependency issues with:
   - p-limit (even with downgrading to version 3.1.0)
   - property-information (import paths)
2. These issues are preventing the application from starting

## Attempted Solutions

1. Downgraded p-limit to version 3.1.0 (the last CommonJS version), but still encountering errors
2. Modified the vite.config.ts to add resolve aliases for property-information
3. Simplified the Markdown rendering to avoid problematic dependencies

## Recommendations

1. Create a new project from scratch with compatible dependencies
2. Extract just the vocabulary components and their dependencies
3. Use a different approach for markdown rendering (e.g., simple HTML or a different markdown library)
4. Consider using a more modern and compatible stack for new development

## Next Steps

1. Extract the key vocabulary components:
   - VocabularyList.tsx
   - VocabularyInput.tsx
   - VocabularyDetail.tsx
   - types.ts
2. Create a new project with a clean dependency set
3. Add only the required dependencies to avoid conflicts
4. Implement the database schema for vocabulary storage
5. Test the vocabulary feature end-to-end
